## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Another simple challenge. The biggest difficulty here is centering the elements properly and guessing the dimensions of paddings, margins and elements from the design screenshot. Still, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. For the first time I started building the mobile design first, then went on to the larger screen sizes. Though the difference between mobile and desktop designs is minimal for this challenge, it's still a solid first step.
